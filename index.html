                <p>Bangladesh is a land of many rivers, and as a result it is very prone to flooding due to being
                    situated on the Brahmaputra River Delta (also known as the Ganges Delta) and the many distributaries
                    flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Due to being part of such a basin and being less than 5 meters above
                    mean sea level, Bangladesh faces the cumulative effects of floods due to water flashing from nearby
                    hills, the accumulation of the inflow of water from upstream catchments, and locally heavy rainfall
                    enhanced by drainage congestion.</p>

                <h2>to suvive</h2>
                <p>Yearly flooding during monsoon season and other forms of inclement weather have forced the people of
                    Bangladesh to adjust their lifestyle in order to prepare for the worst. One thing that people are
                    doing to avoid the effects of the flooding is building elevated houses and roads. The raised houses
                    are built on platforms raised above the typical water level a flood can reach. In many cases,
                    neighbourhoods of people build these raised homes and roads, creating a "cluster village" which is
                    essentially a village that is raised above flood level. This has proven to be very effective at
                    avoiding the immediate effects of flooding.</p>
